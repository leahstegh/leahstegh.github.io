                <p class="d-flex p-2">Hello! My name is Leah Stegh and I am curretly a 9th grader at Lane Tech in Chicago, Illinois. I was born in Chicago and I have lived here for my entire life. Chicago has always been an important place to me, and the history it holds has made me develop a love for the city. The endless opprutunities the city has to offer makes me strive to be a better person every day. As far as personal goals go, I would like to get better at lacrosse and spend more time practicing in order to improve. I would also like to dedicate more time to school work to keep up good grades and relationships with my teachers. Balancing a personal and  professional goals can be challenging at times, but I believe that anyone can do anything that they put their mind too. I also srongly agree that things become easier when one actually wants to do them, so I try to keep a positive attiude about various every day tasks. By doing this, it makes even the challenging tasks seem just a little bit easier.    </p>

                  <p>Cheer is something I have been very passionate about for as long as I remember. 
                    The mix of physical and mental requirements have always kept me engaged. I was on 
                    various competitive club teams for 3 years. Then, I decided to stop in order to be 
                    able to cheer for Lane Tech. After much hard work, the Lane Tech Varsity team won City
                     in January of this year! <br> <button type="button" class="btn"><a href="sports.html">Click Me!</a></button></p>

                  <p>Lacrosse is a sport that I have just started to pick up and I look forward to playing in the spring. I have practiced a lot at home and overall enjoy it. The mix of technique, hand-eye cordination,
                     and agility makes it a very interesting sport to play. The game is engaging and challenging,
                      which is why it is so fun to play and watch. <br> <button type="button" class="btn"><a href="sports.html">Click Me!</a></button></p>

                    <p>While also playing multiple sports, school is always my first priority. It is very important to me to recieve good
                       grades in school in order to maintain a good GPA. As for my favorite subjects, I really enjoy math because it is easy 
                       to stay engaged. Homework is a big priority, and it pays off once it is finally done.
